# PythonTextArtToCode
This simple script converts ASCII//TEXT art to a python print line so that you can print out your art in a console program.

How to use:
1. Paste your desired ASCII/TEXT art into the 'art.txt' file.
2. Run the script by clicking it or running the file in your desired IDE.
3. Open 'code.txt' and copy and paste the code into your code.
4. Enjoy!


I made this so that I save time when embedding ASCII/TEXT art into my programs. Instead of manually going through every line and adding '\'s to prevent errors and new lines, this code does it for you and gives you your art in one line.
